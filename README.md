# 3D-root_length-per-layer-visulization
Raw CT files were obtained by using the X-ray CT scanning tech at Rootomics lab, NARO, Japan. Rinfo were obtained by using RSAvis3D and RSAtrace3D developed by Dr.Shota Teramoto

##Visulization of 3D images
1. Classify roots into 4 categories - colours
2. Interactive plot
3. Animation

##Length per layer
1. Calculate root length in defined soil layers - here divide soils into 30 layers
2. Map cumulative length across the layers
3. Lmm stats + multiple comparison - genotypic differences & plasticity
4. Pearson correlation + lasso - above-ground and root/layer relationship
